Challenge Questions:

How can retrieval-augmented text generation improve the coherence and relevance of language model responses?
    Retrieval-augmented text generation enhances responses by 
    incorporating relevant context from similar text snippets retrieved from a database. 
    This helps the language model generate more coherent and contextually appropriate responses, 
    improving the overall quality of the generated text.

Explain the role of LangChain in the retrieval mechanism for retrieval-augmented text generation.
    LangChain plays a key role in the retrieval mechanism by 
    querying a database of text snippets based on the input query. 
    It ranks the retrieved snippets according to similarity and relevance and 
    then provides the top-ranked snippets to the language model for fine-tuning and 
    context enhancement during text generation.

What are the potential challenges or limitations of using retrieval-augmented text generation in language models?
    Some challenges of retrieval-augmented text generation include 
    finding an appropriate balance between retrieved context and the model's original generation, 
    dealing with out-of-context responses, and ensuring that retrieved snippets are 
    truly relevant and accurate representations of the input query.

How can you evaluate the performance of a retrieval-augmented text generation system?
    The performance of a retrieval-augmented text generation system 
    can be evaluated using metrics like BLEU score, ROUGE score, and human evaluations 
    to assess the quality, relevance, and coherence of the generated responses.
